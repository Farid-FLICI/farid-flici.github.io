 <h2> Who Are We? </h2>
    <p> At the HDSE Research Department, we are a group of enthousiat and dynamic researchers and ingineers from various background:
        statistics,sociology, economics, actuarial sciences, econometric, antropology, operation research ... etc.  </p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="https://github.com/Farid-FLICI/farid-flici.github.io/blob/master/hdse_group_pic.jpg?raw=true"; width="55%" />   </p>

    <h2> What HDSE is about? </h2>
    <p> The HDSE Research Department is one of the four research departments of the Research Center in Applied Economics for 
        Development - CREAD (Algiers, Algeria). HDSE is concerned with studying and analysing social phenomena and their implications
        on the economy.The HDSE research Agenda is focussed on observing recent trends in human development indicator components and 
        investigating ways for their promotion. With Education, Health, and wellbeing being the main components of Human Development 
        Indicators, our research departments tries to analyse and explain changes and behaviours.</p>
    <p> On the other hand, we are intersted in a wide range of population-related discipline such as demography, household economics 
        and finance, labor economics, social protection, pensions, shadow economy, mobility, migration, health transiton, gender, 
        youth, elderly, ... etc.</p>

    <h2> What Do We Do? </h2>
    <p> Our main task is to perform studies to understand and explain social phenomena using quantitative and qualitative approaches
        and to enrich the existing litterature with new findings, methods, and analyses. This also includes contribution to the 
        theory by proposing new approaches and methods for analyses social phenomena.  </p>
    <p> Our research is also intended to guide policymakers for a better decision taking and designing adapted social policies. 
        Thus, the HDSE research department collaborates with differents governemental departments in Algeria, such us the Health 
        Ministry, the Ministry of Statistics, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Ministry of Solidarity, the Ministry 
        of Education, The ministry of Scientific Research and Higher Education, and the Ministry of Finance.  </p>
    <p> The HDSE department collaborates also with ONGs such as the International Labor Organization (ILO), the United Nations Funds 
        for Population (FNUAP), UNICEF, United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and national associations such as the Algerian 
        Association of Social Security Executives... etc. </p>

   <h1> HDSE Research Agenda 2022-2025</h1>

<div style="padding:5px 15px 15px 15px;margin-top:30px; float: center; overflow: hidden">
 <p> As for the 2022-2025 period, research activities of the HDSE department focusse on five main axes, deined following Algeria's 
     Government Program (GP) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG):    </p>
  
 <h2> i) Analyzing Epidemiological and Demographic Transitions </h2>
 <h4> Theme 1 – Analyzing the Epidemiological Transition in Algeria for a More Adapted Healthcare System; (SDG3, SDG10, GP-3-1.1) </h4>
   <p> Epidemiological transition translates as a shift from a situation dominated by communicable diseases as a main cause of death into
      another situation characterized by non-communicable diseases dominance. Consequently, the epidemiological pattern of the transiting 
      population changes implying changes in healthcare needs. Thus, health programs and policies are to be adapted accordingly. For a 
      better health policy making in Algeria, the characteristics of the epidemiological transition need to be studied further. 
      The prevalence of many chronic (non-communicable) diseases is raising leading to morbidity expansion. Thus, disability-free 
      life expectancy is decreasing while life expectancy keeps improving. The diseased population is expected to live longer with the 
      chronic condition and this may imply higher public health and social security spending and lower working years expectancy. Efficient
      public health policies need to be designed to make healthy life expectancy improves at the same pace as life expectancy.</p>
  
  <h4> Theme 2 – Determinants and Consequences of the Demographic Transition in Algeria (GP-3-3.2.2, GP-3-3.2.3, GP-3-3.2.4);</h4>
  <p> Demographic transition show a situation of decrease of mortality rates accompanied with a substantial fall in fertility rates. 
    Consequently, population growth slows down while the share of elderly in the global population becomes more and more important. 
    For the need of public planning, population growth needs to be studied in the framework of a demographic transition framework. 
    Studying the determinants of such a transition returns at studying the trend of mortality changes, the determinants of behavior 
    changes in terms of fertility and marriages. In concerns of the consequences of the demographic transition, one should expect a 
    falling ratio of the population at working age compared to the old age population. 
    It is important to expect and predict the socio-economical implications of such changes in the population age structure.</p>
    
   <h2> ii) Improving Social Protection System for more Efficiency and Longer Sustainability </h2>
   <h4> Theme 1 - Expanding Social Protection and Poverty Alleviation Policies; (SDG1; GP-1-2.3.2, GP-1-2.5.7; GP-3-3.2) </h4>
    <p> Non contributive social protection program aims mainly at alleviate poverty and prevent from falling into poverty. 
      Different programs exist, but their efficiency needs to be enhanced and vulnerable populations need to be targeted more 
      accurately. Public services providing need assessment regarding their effectiveness in fighting poverty. </p>
  
   <h4> Theme 2 – Households Finance, Consumption, and Vulnerability; (SDG12, SDG2, GP-3-3.1, GP-3-3.2, GP-3-4.2 and GP-3-4.3) </h4>
   <p> The understanding of population behaviors in terms of financial decision making and consumption represents a key-element towards 
      studying the needs of a population and their changes in a mutative environment. This may help stakeholders to improve the efficiency 
      of public policies and the acceptability of public decision by the targeted population. The badly designed policies are usually 
      easily rejected and it worth to adapt policies to the characteristics of the targeted population. </p>
  
   <h4> Theme 3 – Expanding Social Insurance to Informal Workers; (SDG8, SDG1, GP-2-1.5) </h4>
   <p> Social security systems are usually made mandatory to ensure a high inter-generational solidarity and risk sharing between the 
      individuals belonging to a given population. Given that people can be arranged into bad and good risks, while contributions are 
      averaged on the global population, the “good risks” tend usually to escape the system. Hence, the cause of such evasion needs to be 
      studied and some the system design needs to be adapted to become more attractive for the different categories of the population. </p>
  
  <h4> Theme 4 – Retirement System Sustainability and Ways of Reforms; (SDG8, SDG1, GP-3-2.3.2, GP-3-3.3)</h4>
  <p> Keeping the sustainability of public retirement systems represents one of the fundamental tools in alleviating poverty among 
    the elder population. Population ageing results in increasing the load of the financial balance of the Pay-As-You-Go retirement 
    systems financed through inter-generational solidarity principle where the contributions of the working population in a given year 
    are directly used to pay the retirement benefits of the same year. Population ageing results in a growing share of the population
    at retirement compared to that of contributors. Decreases in employment rates and rates of enrolment to social security contribute 
    in worsening the situation. Assessing the financial sustainability of retirement systems is a mid-way towards designing adequate 
    reforms. Obviosity, the Algerian retirement system requires some reforms and many options exist. Studying the implications of each
    reform proposal and their feasibility in a changing environment is recommended to avoid reforms fail and reversals which can be very
    costly for the public treasure. </p>
   
  <h2> iii) Understanding Internal and International Mobility </h2>
  <h4> Theme 1 – Sustainable Transport and Urban Planning for a Better Mobility and Living Environment; (SDG11, GP-1.6, GP-3-2.1, GP-3-2.2) </h4> 
    <p> </p>
   <h4> Theme 2 – Irregular migration (Harga);</h4>
                  
  <h2> iv) Evaluating Public Policy in terms of Primary, Secondary, and Higher Education (SDG4, GP-3-1-2) </h2>

 <h2> v) Using Computer Sciences for Social Analysis (GP-1-2.5.6) </h2>
  <h4> Theme 1 - Digital Demographics </h4>
    <p> Digital Demographics aims at using data from social media to estimate population-related indicators and to 
      study the different demographic phenomena. </p>
    <h4> Theme 2 - Computational Social Science </h4>
    <p> Computational social science refers to using « Computer Science » for analysing « social phenomena ». 
      The recent developments in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning provided alternative ways to study 
      social phenomena, more efficiently, using less time and effort, and covering larger populations.</p>
